{"title":"17. Anger ","text":"Minor Collection Sayings of the Dhamma 221–234 17. Anger Give up anger, get rid of conceit, and escape every fetter. Sufferings don’t befall one who has nothing, not clinging to name and form. When anger surges like a lurching chariot, keep it in check. That’s what I call a charioteer; others just hold the reins. Defeat anger with kindness, villainy with virtue, stinginess with giving, and lies with truth. Speak the truth, do not be angry, and give when asked, if only a little. By these three means, you may enter the presence of the gods. Those harmless sages, always restrained in body, go to the state that does not pass, where there is no sorrow. Always wakeful, practicing night and day, focused only on extinguishment, their defilements come to an end. It’s always been this way, Atula, it’s not just today. They blame you when you’re silent, they blame you when you speak a lot, and even when you speak just right: no-one in the world escapes blame. There never was, nor will be, nor is there today, someone who is wholly praised or wholly blamed. If, after watching them day in day out, discerning people praise that sage of impeccable conduct, endowed with ethics and wisdom; like a pendant of Black Plum River gold, who is worthy to criticize them? Even the gods praise them, and by the Divinity, too, they’re praised. Guard against ill-tempered deeds, be restrained in body. Giving up bad bodily conduct, conduct yourself well in body. Guard against ill-tempered words, be restrained in speech. Giving up bad verbal conduct, conduct yourself well in speech. Guard against ill-tempered thoughts, be restrained in mind. Giving up bad mental conduct, conduct yourself well in mind. An attentive one is restrained in body restrained also in speech, in thought, too, they are restrained: they are restrained in every way."}
