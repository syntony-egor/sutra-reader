{"title":"16. The Beloved ","text":"Minor Collection Sayings of the Dhamma 209–220 16. The Beloved Applying yourself where you ought not, neglecting what you should be doing, forgetting your goal, you cling to what you hold dear, jealous of those devoted to their heart’s goal. Don’t ever get too close to those you like or dislike. For not seeing the liked is suffering, and so is seeing the disliked. Therefore don’t hold anything dear, for it’s bad to lose those you love. No ties are found in they who hold nothing loved or loathed. Sorrow springs from what we hold dear, fear springs from what we hold dear; one free from holding anything dear has no sorrow, let alone fear. Sorrow springs from attachment, fear springs from attachment; one free from attachment has no sorrow, let alone fear. Sorrow springs from relishing, fear springs from relishing; one free from relishing has no sorrow, let alone fear. Sorrow springs from desire, fear springs from desire; one free from desire has no sorrow, let alone fear. Sorrow springs from craving, fear springs from craving; one free from craving has no sorrow, let alone fear. One accomplished in virtue and vision, firmly principled, and truthful, doing oneself what ought be done: that’s who the people love. One eager to realize the ineffable would be filled with awareness. Their mind not bound to pleasures of sense, they’re said to be heading upstream. When a man returns safely after a long time spent abroad, family, friends, and loved ones celebrate his return. Just so, when one who has done good goes from this world to the next, their good deeds receive them there, as family welcomes home one they love."}
