{"title":"Unborn ","text":"So It Was Said 43 The Book of the Twos Chapter Two Free of Rebirth This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard. “There is, mendicants, freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned. If there were no freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned, then you would find no escape here from rebirth, from what has been produced, made, and conditioned. But since there is freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned, an escape is found from rebirth, from what has been produced, made, and conditioned.” The Buddha spoke this matter. On this it is said: “What’s reborn, produced, and arisen, made, conditioned, not lasting, wrapped in old age and death, frail, a nest of disease, whose inception is the leash to food: that’s not fit to delight in. The escape from that is peaceful, beyond the scope of logic, everlasting, where nothing is reborn or arisen, the sorrowless, stainless state, the cessation of all painful things, the blissful stilling of conditions.” This too is a matter that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard."}
