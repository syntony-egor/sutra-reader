{"title":"3. The Mind ","text":"Minor Collection Sayings of the Dhamma 33–43 3. The Mind The mind quivers and shakes, hard to guard, hard to curb. The discerning straighten it out, like a fletcher straightens an arrow. Like a fish pulled from the sea and cast upon the shore, this mind flounders about, trying to throw off Māra’s dominion. Hard to hold back, flighty, alighting where it will; it’s good to tame the mind; a tamed mind leads to bliss. So hard to see, so subtle, alighting where it will; the discerning protect the mind, a guarded mind leads to bliss. The mind travels far, wandering alone; incorporeal, it lies hidden in the heart. Those who will restrain the mind are freed from Māra’s bonds. Those of unsteady mind, who don’t understand the true teaching, and whose confidence wavers, do not perfect their wisdom. One whose mind is not festering, whose heart is undamaged, who’s given up right and wrong, alert, has nothing to fear. Knowing this body breaks like a pot, and fortifying the mind like a citadel, attack Māra with the sword of wisdom, guard your conquest, and never settle. All too soon this body will lie upon the earth, bereft of consciousness, tossed aside like a worthless log. A wrongly directed mind would do you more harm than a hater to the hated, or an enemy to their foe. A rightly directed mind would do you more good than your mother or father or any other relative."}
