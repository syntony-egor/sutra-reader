{"title":"True Blessings ","text":"Anthology of Discourses 2.4 Blessings So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse: “Many gods and humans have thought about blessings desiring well-being: declare the highest blessing.” “Not to fraternize with fools, but to fraternize with the wise, and honoring those worthy of honor: this is the highest blessing. Living in a suitable region, having made merit in the past, being rightly resolved in oneself, this is the highest blessing. Education and a craft, discipline and training, and well-spoken speech: this is the highest blessing. Caring for mother and father, kindness to children and partners, and unstressful work: this is the highest blessing. Giving and righteous conduct, kindness to relatives, blameless deeds: this is the highest blessing. Desisting and abstaining from evil, avoiding drinking liquor, diligence in good qualities: this is the highest blessing. Respect and humility, contentment and gratitude, and timely listening to the teaching: this is the highest blessing. Patience, being easy to admonish, the sight of ascetics, and timely discussion of the teaching: this is the highest blessing. Fervor and chastity seeing the noble truths, and realization of extinguishment: this is the highest blessing. Though touched by worldly things, their mind does not tremble; sorrowless, stainless, secure, this is the highest blessing. Having completed these things, undefeated everywhere; everywhere they go in safety: this is their highest blessing.”"}
