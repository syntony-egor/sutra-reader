{"title":"Crossing the Flood ","text":"Linked Discourses 1.1 1. A Reed Crossing the Flood So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Good fellow, how did you cross the flood?” “Neither standing nor swimming, good sir, I crossed the flood.” “But in what way did you cross the flood neither standing nor swimming?” “When I stood, I sank under. When I swam, I was swept away. That’s how I crossed the flood neither standing nor swimming.” “After a long time I see a brahmin fully quenched. Neither standing nor swimming, he’s crossed over clinging to the world.” This is what that deity said, and the teacher approved. Then that deity, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there."}
